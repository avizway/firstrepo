Adding here
When http.sslBackend is not configured (e.g. in portable Git or MinGit), fetch/push operations no longer crash.
On Windows 7 and older, Git for Windows v2.16.1(2) was no longer able to spawn any processes (e.g. during fetch/clone). This regression has been fixed.
The Perl upgrade in v2.16.1(2) broke git send-email; This has been fixed by updating the Net-SSLeay Perl module.
